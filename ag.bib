  abstract = {1933–1989 data yielded a strong, positive Spearman's coefficient of .996 for the average number of presidential news conferences per month and presidential rankings in the Murray-Blessing Poll. The finding supports research on the mere-exposure effect and is consistent with studies showing a tendency for group members to associate talkativeness with leadership.}
